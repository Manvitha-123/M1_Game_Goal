Design the game of Snake & Ladder
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Create a Snake and Ladder application.
- The application should take input n from the user.
- The game should have a board size of n x n.
- There should be n snakes and n ladders placed randomly in the board.
- Each snake will have its head at some number and its tail at a smaller number.
- Each ladder will have its start position at some number and end position at a larger number.
- There can be multiple players in the game.


Rules
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The board has numbers from 1 to n^2.
- The players will make there move turn-by-turn.
- The game will have a six sided dice numbered from 1 to 6 and will always give a random number on rolling it.
- Each player has a piece which is initially kept outside the board (i.e., at position 0).
- Each player rolls the dice when their turn comes.
- Based on the dice value, the player moves their piece forward that number of cells. Ex: If the dice value is 2 and the player is at position 8, the player will move to position 10 (2+8).
- A player wins if he reached the last cell in the board.
- Whenever a player ends up at a cell with the head of the snake, the player should go down to the cell that has the tail of that snake.
- Whenever a player ends up at a cell with the start of the ladder, the player should go up to the cell that has the end of that ladder.
- The game should continue till there are at least 2 players still playing to win.
- After the dice roll, if a piece is supposed to move outside position 100, it does not move.
- Snakes and Ladders do not create a cycle.



Skills
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Snake and ladder game allows students to understand the concept of Mathematics easily. 
- In addition, students can be exposed to the operations of addition and subtraction indirectly and it is also a suitable activity for leisure time. 
- This is to promote social skills and interaction among the players.
