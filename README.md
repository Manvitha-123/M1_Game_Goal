Snake and Ladder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Snakes and ladders, known originally as Moksha Patam, is an ancient Indian board game for two or more players regarded today as a worldwide classic.
-  It is played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. 
-  The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing ladders but    hindered by falling down snakes.
- The game is a simple race based on sheer luck, and it is popular with young children.
- The historic version had its roots in morality lessons, on which a player's progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues (ladders) and vices (snakes). 
- The game is also sold under other names such as Chutes and Ladders, Bible Ups and Downs, etc., some with a morality motif ; a morality Chutes and Ladders was published by the Milton Bradley Company starting from 1943.
