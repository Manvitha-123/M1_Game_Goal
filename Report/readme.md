Snakes and ladders, known originally as Moksha Patam.
Snakes and ladders is an ancient Indian board game that's regarded today as a worldwide classic. 
It requires two or more players and takes place on a board with numbered, gridded squares. 
Throughout the board, there are 'snakes' and 'ladders' which connect different squares. Players roll a die and navigate the board.
The historic version had its roots in morality lessons, on which a player's progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues (ladders) and vices (snakes).
The game is also sold under other names such as 'Chutes and Ladders', Bible Ups and Downs.
Snakes and ladders originated in India as part of a family of dice board games that included 'gyan chauper and pachisi' (known in English as Ludo and Parcheesi).
According to some historians, the game was invented by "Saint Gyandev" in the 13th century AD. 
Originally, the game was used as a part of moral instruction to children.
