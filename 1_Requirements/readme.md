Requirements of Snake and Ladder
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Each player puts their counter on the space that says 'start here'.
- Take it in turns to roll the dice. 
- If your counter lands at the bottom of a ladder, you can move up to the top of the ladder.
- If your counter lands on the head of a snake, you must slide down to the bottom of the snake.
