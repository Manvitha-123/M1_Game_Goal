   INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Snakes and ladders, known originally as Moksha Patam.
Snakes and ladders is an ancient Indian board game that's regarded today as a worldwide classic. 
It requires two or more players and takes place on a board with numbered, gridded squares. 
Throughout the board, there are 'snakes' and 'ladders' which connect different squares. Players roll a die and navigate the board.
The historic version had its roots in morality lessons, on which a player's progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues (ladders) and vices (snakes).
The game is also sold under other names such as 'Chutes and Ladders', Bible Ups and Downs.
Snakes and ladders originated in India as part of a family of dice board games that included 'gyan chauper and pachisi' (known in English as Ludo and Parcheesi).
According to some historians, the game was invented by "Saint Gyandev" in the 13th century AD. 
Originally, the game was used as a part of moral instruction to children.

  OBJECTIVE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The object of the game is to navigate one's game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing ladders but hindered by falling down snakes. 
The game is a simple race based on sheer luck, and it is popular with young children.
The idea is to consider the given snake and ladder board as a directed graph with number of vertices equal to the number of cells in the board. 
The problem reduces to finding the shortest path in a graph. 
Every vertex of the graph has an edge to next six vertices if next 6 vertices do not have a snake or ladder.
